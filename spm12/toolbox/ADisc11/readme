The 'Brain Hemisphere Segmentation' package is designed to use the Adaptive
Disconnection method to segment the brain volume in 3D MRI into the left 
cerebral hemisphere, right cerebral hemisphere, left cerebellum, right 
cerebellum and brainstem. The method is described in

To use the package, first, you should compile the 'Info_Map_Gen.c' file 
into mex-file (mex file for 32-bit Windows XP is included already). This 
can be done, most of the time, by using the matlab script: 
'mex Info_Map_Gen.c'. 

The main function is 'Adaptive_Disconnection.m'. To implement the segmentation, 
input the tissue fraction estimates and the voxel size of the processed image
into 'Adaptive_Disconnection.m'. The output is a matrix containing the 
segmented(labeled) brain volume. It is recommended to produce the tissue 
fraction estimates using function 'pvemri.m' or its mex-based implementation 
'pvemrimex.m' (Download link: http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jupeto/matlab_code/pvemri.zip).
